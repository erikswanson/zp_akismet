This plugin allows a ZenPhoto installation to use the Akismet spam filtering service.

It is not yet complete or suitable for general use. Currently, while this plugin is active, attempting to post a comment on anything that is not an image, such as an album or ZenPage item, results in an unrecoverable error.

To install this plugin:
1. In the 'plugins' folder of your ZenPhoto installation, create a folder named 'spamfilters' if it does not already exist.
2. Place the akismet.php file in the 'spamfilters' folder.
3. In the ZenPhoto Administration interface, under options > comment, select the akismet spam filter and configure it with your Akismet API key.
