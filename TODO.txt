This plugin should allow comments on receiver classes other than images, with albums being the most important.

The timeout used when communicating with the Akismet server should be configurable.

This plugin should send an appropriate User Agent to the Akismet servers, for accountability in the event of a programming error.

The plugin should somehow declare that it requires libcurl and be impossible to activate if libcurl not installed.

The behavior of sending emails to administrators when an error is encountered should be configurable.

The admin interface should validate the API key and not allow the administrator to activate this plugin without a valid API key.

The function to mass-email administrators should be factored out in ZenPhoto iself and then removed from this plugin.

As a far-future goal, the comment administration interface should support false-negative and false-positive feedback. This will require upstream modification of the SpamFilter class interface.
